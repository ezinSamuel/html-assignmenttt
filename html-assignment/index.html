        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Samuel,and i am currently studying Interative Media Design at Algonquin College. I have a strong passion for this program and really love working with both design and coding aspects. Originally from <abbr title="Nigeria"></abbr>,I speak <em>English</em> and Pidgin. With a background in digital art and photography,I have developed a strong appreciation for compostion, color,and storytelling.

            I enjoy working with various design tools and technologies to craft seamless and visually appealing digital experiences. When Im not designing, I spend my time reading science fiction, practicing martial arts going to the gym, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I believe that design has the power to inspire and transform, and I aim to create experiences that leave a lasting impact.
